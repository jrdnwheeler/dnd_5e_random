Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e Random Character Generator

My friends and I have moved onto DND 5e for our gaming group, and I've noticed some of our characters are dying quickly (might be our DMs fault).  So instead of sitting out for a long time rolling up a new character I wanted to write a quick random generator.  It won't be a min/max character, but a fairly random smattering of options and choices to get your back to the game.

Enjoy!
